I was born in 1983, my name is Allen Tools. In my free time I read about stuff, I'm into fitness, healthcare, behavioral sciences, playing with numbers, technology, fantasy, and animation. My professional life is in Data Sciences, Computer Science, and Consulting, I used to run a professional website and service individual clients but am currently only entertaining full time offers for corporate level positions. 

I'd be happy to talk to you so send me an email at mr@allen.tools to chat.
